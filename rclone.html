        I have been using <a href="https://rclone.org/">Rclone</a> to manage my
        files for a few years now, and have developed a workflow of sorts for
        it.
        <br><br>
        My setup definitely won't fit most people's needs, but I hope this text
        will give you some inspiration to incorporate Rclone around your own
        workflow. It's an extremely useful tool that can automate surprisingly
        many cloud storage and backup related tasks.

    <h2 class="text">General rules</h2>
    <p class="text">
        In order to make the most out of Rclone and its capability for
        automation, I try to stick to the following general rules when
        organizing my files:
        <br><br>
        <b class="dot-item">1.</b>
        <br><br>
        All files will be categorized under one of five top-level folders:
        <code>Audio</code>, <code>Documents</code>, <code>Literature</code>,
        <code>Pictures</code> and <code>Videos</code>. These may vary
        widely depending on your files, but in general it's important to
        categorize every file around a set of generic folders.
        <br><br>
        The top-level folders can also be verbs if it makes more sense to you,
        eg. <code>Listen</code>, <code>Write</code>, <code>Read</code>, 
        <code>Watch</code> and <code>Study</code>.
        <br><br>
        <b class="dot-item">2.</b>
        <br><br>
        All files will be placed in subfolders under the top-level folders, eg.
        <code>Audio/Podcasts</code>, <code>Audio/Music</code>,
        <code>Literature/Books</code>, <code>Literature/Comics</code>.
        <br><br>
        Files should never be placed directly under a top-level folder, as
        there is always a subcategory they can be placed under. Keeping files
        in at least depth 2 or higher in the directory tree will also help with
        automation later on.
        <br><br>
        <b class="dot-item">3.</b>
        <br><br>
        Files placed under the previously mentioned subfolders need to follow a
        consistent file naming convention and folder structure, but <b>only
        limited to their respective subfolders</b>.
        <br><br>
        For example, files placed in <code>Audio/Music</code> could be
        categorized further
        in subfolders <code>"Album Artist/Album Name"</code>, whereas files
        placed in <code>Literature/Books</code> wouldn't need to be placed in subfolders,
        instead named as <code>"Author - Title (Year)"</code>.
        <br><br>
        The most important part is that each subfolder's files should be placed
        at a consistent folder depth. For example, files in <code>Audio/Music</code> will
        all be placed at depth 4:
        <code>Audio/Music/Album Artist/Album Name/## Track Title.mp3</code>,
        whereas files placed in <code>Literature/Books</code> will all be placed at depth
        2: <code>Literature/Books/Author - Title (Year).epub</code>.
