    <p class="text">
        I have been using <a href="https://rclone.org/">Rclone</a> to backup my
        files for a few years now, and have developed a workflow of sorts for
        it. I'll discuss ways in which I organize my files and how that allows
        me to automatically create verifiable and "portable" backups with
        Rclone.
        <br><br>
        My setup definitely won't fit most people's needs, but I hope this will
        give you some inspiration on how to incorporate Rclone around your own
        workflow. It's an extremely useful tool that can automate surprisingly
        many cloud storage and backup related tasks.

    <h2 class="text">General rules</h2>
    <p class="text">
        In order to make the most out of Rclone and its capability for
        automation, I try to stick to the following general rules when
        organizing my files:
        <br><br>
        <b class="dot-item">1.</b>
        <br><br>
        All files will be categorized under one of six top-level folders:
        <code>Audio</code>, <code>Documents</code>, <code>Literature</code>,
        <code>Pictures</code>, <code>Software</code> and <code>Videos</code>.
        These may vary widely depending on your files, but in general it's
        important to categorize every file around a set of generic folders.
        <br><br>
        The top-level folders can also be verbs if it makes more sense to you,
        eg. <code>Listen</code>, <code>Write</code>, <code>Read</code>, 
        <code>Watch</code>, <code>Program</code> and <code>Study</code>.
        <br><br>
        <b class="dot-item">2.</b>
        <br><br>
        All files will be placed in subfolders under the top-level folders, eg.
        <code>Audio/Podcasts</code>, <code>Audio/Music</code>,
        <code>Videos/Movies</code>, <code>Videos/TV Shows</code>.
        <br><br>
        Files should never be placed directly under a top-level folder, as
        there is always a subcategory they can be placed under. Keeping files
        in at least depth 2 or higher in the directory tree will also help with
        automation later on.
        <br><br>
        <b class="dot-item">3.</b>
        <br><br>
        Files placed under the previously mentioned subfolders need to follow a
        consistent file naming convention and folder structure, but <b>only
        limited to their respective subfolders</b>.
        <br><br>
        For example, files placed in <code>Audio/Music</code> could be
        categorized further in subfolders <code>"Album Artist/Album
        Name"</code>, whereas files placed in <code>Videos/Movies</code>
        wouldn't need to be placed in subfolders, instead named as <code>"Movie
        Title (Year)"</code>.
        <br><br>
        The most important part is that each subfolder's files should be placed
        at <b>a consistent folder depth</b>. For example, files in
        <code>Audio/Music</code> will all be placed at depth 4:
        <code>Audio/Music/Album Artist/Album Name/## Track Title.mp3</code>,
        whereas files placed in <code>Videos/Movies</code> will all be placed
        at depth 2: <code>Videos/Movies/Movie Title (Year).mkv</code>.
        <br><br>
        I wrote a simple
        <a href="https://github.com/patoporh/bash-scripts/blob/main/file-depths">Bash script</a>
        to help keep track of this. The script prints out each depth files are
        found at for a given directory.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text">Cataloguing file depths</h2>
    <p class="text">
    When files are organized following the aforementioned rules, some
    interesting automation will become possible. Let's say that each of the
    subfolders and their common file depths are catalogued in a TSV-file, like
    so:
    </p>
    <pre>
2	Audio/Music
0	Literature/Books
0	Videos/Movies
2	Videos/TV Shows</pre>
    <p class="text">
    The first field will specify a consistent depth for files <b>relative</b>
    to the given subfolder. This means that <code>Audio/Music</code>'s common
    subfolders <code>Album Artist/Album Name</code> make files reside at depth
    2, whereas files placed directly under <code>Literature/Books</code> are at
    depth 0.
    <br><br>
    With this TSV-file quite a lot of automation has now become possible. The
    following sections will contain some examples of this.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text">Creating checksums</h2>
    <p class="text">
    In order to create backups, more specifically <b>verifiable</b> backups, we
    need to have checksums for everything. This is something backup tools like
    <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">Borg</a> and
    <a href="https://restic.net/">Restic</a> will always create for you.
    However, something I dislike about these methods is their own ways of
    browsing and managing the resulting backups. These tools have their own
    commands for listing, verifying, mounting and restoring files in a backup.
    <br><br>
    Having become quite familiar with Rclone over the past few years, I wanted
    to achieve something similar to these backup tools entirely within Rclone.
    Turns out, it's entirely possible to create backups with Rclone when using
    it with the option
    <a href="https://rclone.org/flags/#sync"><code>--backup-dir</code></a>.
    <br><br>
    To create backups with Rclone, checksum files need to be created. Unlike
    more traditional backup tools, Rclone won't automatically create these for
    you. This is where the aforementioned TSV-file comes in handy. Since the
    file depth specified for each subfolder means that no files should be
    placed above that given depth, we can create checksums for all files under
    that depth.
    <br><br>
    In order to automate this, I wrote a Bash script called
    <a href="https://github.com/patoporh/bash-scripts/blob/main/new-md5"><code>new-md5</code></a>.
